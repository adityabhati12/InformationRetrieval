concern some solut boundari layer equat hydrodynam boundari layer equat steadi two dimension motion solv ani given initi veloc distribut distribut along normal boundari wall downstream which motion calcul initi veloc distribut assum express polynomi distanc from wall three case consid first when initi distribut veloc vanish wall gradient along normal doe second when veloc initi distribut doe vanish wall third when both veloc normal gradient vanish wall point where forward flow separ from boundari solut found power seri some fraction power distanc along wall whose coeffici function distanc from wall found from ordinari differenti equat some progress made numer calcul coeffici especi first case main object find mean step step calcul veloc field boundari layer thought procedur mai possibl success even labori same mathemat method us calcul flow behind flat plate along stream result shown curv origin
